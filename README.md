James Pharaoh <james@pharaoh.uk>

This is a partial Rust clone of [ZBackup](http://zbackup.org/), along with some
unique features of its own.

This project is free software and available under the [Apache 2.0 licence]
(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Binaries for ubuntu are available can be downloaded [here]
(https://dist.wellbehavedsoftware.com/rzbackup/).

Online documentation is automatically generated by [docs.rs]
(https://docs.rs/rzbackup/).

## List of features

* Rust library for access to ZBackup repositories
* Supports encrypted and non encrypted formats
* Multi-threaded restore and configurable, multi-tier chunk cache
* Client/server utilities to efficiently restore multiple backups with a shared
  chunk cache
* RandomAccess implements Read and Seek to provide efficient random access for
  rust applications
* Balance tools to redistribute data in index and bundle files, typically useful
  to obtain a smaller number of consistently-sized files
* Thorough garbage collection tools to clean up indexes and chunks which are no
  longer in use
* Check tools, to verify the integrity of the repository in various ways, and
  repair simple problems
* Command line decrypt utility, mostly useful for debugging

Notable missing features

* No facility to create backups, these must be performed with the original
  ZBackup tool
* Verification of backup checksums is not performed

## Library usage

In cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
rzbackup = '3.1'
```

Example code, for demonstration (won't compile):

```rust
extern crate rzbackup;

use rzbackup::Repository;
use rzbackup::RandomAccess;

fn main () {

	let mut repository =
		Repository::open (
			"/path/to/repository",
			Some ("/path/to/password/file"));

	repository.restore (
		"/backup-name",
		output_stream ());

	let mut random_access =
		RandomAccess::new (
			repository,
			"/backup-name");

	do_something_with_random_access (
		random_access);

}
```

## Command usage

### Restore

The restore command is able to perform a one-off restore. It is basically
equivalent to ZBackup's own `restore` command. The restored content is piped to
stdout.

```sh
rzbackup restore \
	--repository REPOSITORY \
	[--password-file PASSWORD-FILE] \
	--backup-name BACKUP-NAME
```

### Server

The server process listens for client connections and streams backups over a
socket. It has a large cache and so will be more efficient than running separate
restore processes for backed up data with lots of shared deduplicated content.

```sh
rzbackup server \
	--listen-address HOST:PORT \
	--repository REPOSITORY \
	[--password-file PASSWORD-FILE] \
	... (lots more options, try --help)
```

### Client

The client connects to the server and streams a backup to standard output. It
can also tell the server to reload its indexes, which will be necessary if new
backups have been made.

```sh
rzbackup client reindex \
	--server-address HOST:PORT
```

```sh
rzbackup-client restore \
	--server-address HOST:PORT \
	--backup-name BACKUP-NAME
```

### Convert

The convert tool makes low-level changes to the repository. It is able to
balance both index and bundle files, changing the number of entries they
contain. It can perform garbage collection, removing index entries and chunk
data which is no longer referenced by any backups. It is able to perform various
consistency checks.

#### Balance bundles

```sh
rzbackup-convert balance-bundles \
    --repository REPOSITORY \
    --password-file PASSWORD-FILE
```

The `balance-bundles` tool balances the number of chunks contained in bundle
files. This consists of reading all index files in order to determine which
bundles contain more or less than the desired number of chunks, then reading
those bundles and writing them out to new bundles with the required number of
chunks in each one.

This writes out a new index file for each bundle, currently, so you may want to
follow this by running `balance-indexes`.

#### Balance indexes

```sh
rzbackup-convert balance-indexes \
    --repository REPOSITORY \
    --password-file PASSWORD-FILE
```

The `balance-indexes` tool balances the number of bundles indexed in individual
index files. This consists of reading all indexes to determine which have more
or less than the desired number of bundles, then writing out the information
about those bundles to new index files with the desired number of bundles in
each one.

#### Garbage collect indexes

```sh
rzbackup-convert gc-indexes \
    --repository REPOSITORY \
    --password-file PASSWORD-FILE
```

The `gc-indexes` tool performs garbage collection on index files. This consists
of identifying all the chunks which are referenced by backups, then rewriting
the index files to remove any chunks which are no longer needed.

Note that this will not make any changes to bundles, so you probably want to
then run `gc-bundles`, to remove the chunks which are no longer needed.

#### Garbage collect bundles

```sh
rzbackup convert gc-bundles \
    --repository REPOSITORY \
    --password-file PASSWORD-FILE
```

The `gc-bundles` tool performs garbage collection on bundles. This consists of
identifying all chunks which are referenced in index files, then rewriting the
bundles to remove any chunks which are no longer needed.

This will also remove any chunks which are duplicated. These will not be removed
from the index, which can cause problems with restore operations which reference
the duplicated chunks, but this cam be remedied with the `rebuild-indexes` tool.

#### Rebuild indexes

TODO

### Decrypt

This is mostly useful for debugging. It allows you to show the decrypted
contents of any backup, index or bundle file in a ZBackup repository.

```sh
rzbackup decrypt \
	--repository REPOSITORY \
	--password-file PASSWORD-FILE \
	--encrypted file ENCRYPTED-FILE
```
